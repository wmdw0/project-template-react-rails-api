# FlatIron School - Phase 4 Project
Phase 4 Project for FlatIron School SE Program

# Requirements:
For this project, you must:
- Use a Rails API backend with a React frontend
- Have at least two models, with a one-to-many relationship on the backend, with full C.R.U.D. actions for at least one. 
- Have at least two different client-side routes using React Router.
- Implement authentication/authorization. At a minimum, a user should be able to log into the site and stay logged in via user ID in the session hash. Password protection is optional. 


# FlatIron Phase 4 Project - Twitter
To conclude Phase 4 of FlatIron Schoolâ€™s Software Engineering program, I chose to build a functional, low-level, version of Twitter with a Rails API Backend, and a React frontend. Throughout this project, I cover how to allow users to create accounts, how to securely store users credentials in your database, how to allow users to log in if they have already created an account, and how to add what is necessary to make this fully functional. 

# Features 

As a non-authenticated user, I can: 
- Access the /login page and /signup page
- Sign up, if I do not yet have an account
- Log in, if I have previously created an account

As an authenticated user, I can: 
- Access the platform, without restrictions
- Create a new tweet via the TweetBox within feed(containing text and/or image and/or location)
- Edit or delete a previous tweet 
- View posts in my feed
- Like, retweet, or comment on a tweet, regardless if we created it or not
- Use sidebar to navigate to other parts of the site
- Search via searchbar

# Conclusion 
In conclusion, the goal of this project was to apply what was taught throughout the Software Engineering program up to this point to create a functional, low-level version of Twitter and successfully meet the project requirements. 

The requirements were to: 

- (1) Use a Rails API backend with a React frontend, 
- (2) Have at least two models, with a one-to-many relationship on the backend, with full CRUD actions for at least one. 
- (3) Have at least two different client-side routes using React Router, 
- (4) Implement authentication/authorization, and optionally include password protection. 

We covered how to allow users to create accounts, how to securely store users credentials in your database, how to allow users to log in if they have already created an account, and how to add what is necessary to make this fully functional.
